<h1>Report Combine and Send Out</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    The goal of this script is to collect the reports from all the people who are going to join the meeting. <br>
    There are three part in the script:<br><br>
       <h4><i>1. Email checking and downloading<br></i></h4>
        Check all the emails if the subject contain the keywords, for instance "meeting", "report", or "daily"; if it contains the keyword, the script check the attachment then download to the local folder. The file will be renamed based on the name of the file which the file name needs to be managed in a certain way.<br>
      <h4><i>2. Combining files<br></i></h4>
        Most of cases in my application, the files are in word or excel format. In the second part, the script convert the word and excel files into PDF file then combine it to gether. Finally, all the files will be deleted from the local folder.<br>
      <h4><i>3. Sending Email<br></i></h4>
        In the last part of the script, connecting to the Email server then send out the Email to specific people.
